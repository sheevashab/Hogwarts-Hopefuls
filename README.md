## Overview

_**Hogwarts Hopefuls** is a full-stack app where users can sign up for an added touch of magic to their lives. The app will sort the user into their respective Hogwarts house based on their answer to a riddle. Each student, or user, can also select their pet, patronus, and specialty spell._


<br>

## MVP

_The **Hogwarts Hopefuls** MVP will be a full-stack, RESTful app. Its backend will employ full CRUD via Ruby on Rails, while its frontend will be a React App with full CRUD._

<br>

### Goals

- _Full-stack, React on Rails application_
- _Full CRUD functionality on backend and frontend_
- _RESTful JSON API with at least 3 tables and 1 association_
- _Employ 2 media queries for responsive design_
- _Deploy via Heroky and Netlify_

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. Include a link to your component tree

[Component Tree Sample](https://gist.git.generalassemb.ly/davidtwhitlatch/414107e2560ae0bb65e233570f2fe056#file-component-tree-png)

#### Component Architecture

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Time Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
